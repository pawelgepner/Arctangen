## BUILD INSTRUCTION

Environment: Arduino IDE   Version 2.3.2

Board: Arduino Due

MC: Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU

https://store.arduino.cc/en-pl/products/arduino-due

To run the selected project, download the folder of this project and then run the *.ino file - the Arduino IDE environment will start, where you should configure the indicated board. 

Can also download only *.ino files - the Arduino IDE environment should automatically create the project and add the necessary peripheral files when launched.
